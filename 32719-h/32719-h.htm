<h1>Mr. President</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>By STEPHEN ARR</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>He had been overwhelmingly elected.
Messages of sympathy poured in, but
they couldn't help ... nothing could.</p></div>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_g1.jpg" alt="G" width="41" height="50" /></div>
<p>eorge Wong stood
pale and silent by the
video screen, listening to
the election returns, a long-stemmed
glass of champagne clutched
forgotten in his trembling right
hand.</p>

<p>The announcer droned on: "&mdash;latest
returns from Venus, with
half of the election districts reporting,
give three billion four
hundred and ninety-six million
votes for Wong, against one billion,
four hundred million for
Thompson, one billion one hundred
million for Miccio, and nine
hundred million for Kau. These
results, added to the almost complete
returns from Earth and the
first fragmentary reports from
Mars, clearly indicate a landslide
vote for Wong as the next President
of the Solar Union. The two
billion votes from Ganymede and
Callisto, which will be received
early tomorrow morning, cannot
appreciably affect the results. The
battle for the twenty-five Vice-Presidents
is less clear. It is certain
that Thompson, Miccio,
Kau, Singh, and DuLavier will
all be among those elected, but
in what order is not yet...."</p>

<p>Wong leaned over and snapped
the video off. His shoulders sagged.
He leaned against the console
as though too tired to move,
a slight, narrow-shouldered man
with a very high forehead and
thin receding black hair. His
large, sad, almond-shaped eyes
and yellow-tinted skin indicated
that there was a good deal of
Asiatic in the mixed blood that
flowed through his veins.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, truly sorry,"
Michael Thompson said sympathetically,
placing a friendly arm
across the narrow shoulders of the
successful candidate. They were
alone in the living room of the
hotel suite in New Geneva, which
they had shared for the campaign.
"The people chose well.
After the wonderful job you did
in organizing the colonization of
Io and Europa, you were the logical
man. And then you do have
the fantastic Responsibility Quotient
of 9.6 out of 10. Anyway,"
he added with a weary shrug,
"don't feel too bad&mdash;it looks as
though I'll be First Vice-President."</p>

<p>A brief ghost of a smile crossed
George Wong's face. "We who
are about to die salute you," he
said, lifting his glass in a bitter
toast to the blank video screen.</p>

<p>Thompson, the man who was
to be First Vice-President, silently
joined him.</p>

<p>"At least," Wong sighed, putting
his empty glass down on the
video, "I don't have a family.
Look at poor Kau. At Miccio.
With wives and children, how
they must have suffered when
they learned they had been drafted
by the conventions.... Well, I
guess there's nothing else to do
but to go to bed and wait until
they come for me in the morning.
Good night, Michael."</p>

<p>"Good night, George," Michael
Thompson said. He turned toward
his own room. "I <i>am</i> sorry,"
he said again.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_w.jpg" alt="W" width="51" height="40" /></div>

<p>ong had already eaten
breakfast and was dressed
in an inconspicuous tweed suit
for the inauguration when the
chimes sounded, telling him that
they were at the door. Slowly, he
walked to the door and opened
it.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. President,"
the man outside said
cheerily, flashing his famous grin.
George Wong immediately recognized
Al Grimm, the man who
had been personal secretary to
sixty-three Presidents. He was
one of the vast army of civil servants
who kept the wheels of
government turning smoothly until
Presidents were able to make
the decisions that would create
policy.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Al," George
Wong said. "I am afraid I'll have
to place myself completely in
your hands for these first few
days. Do we go to the Executive
Mansion for the inauguration
now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Then, after your inauguration,
to the office. Messages
of condolence have been
pouring in all night, but I don't
think you want to bother with
them. However, I am afraid we
will have to bring up some of the
problems that have arisen in the
two weeks since President Reynolds
left office."</p>

<p>"How is he?" Wong asked. "I
knew him, you know. He taught
at Venus University at the same
time I did. He was a fine man."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he's no better," Al
said, shaking his head. "We're
doing all we can for him, but he
won't even speak to his wife. You
know how difficult it is."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," Wong said.</p>

<p>They rode downstairs in silence
and walked to the Presidential
Copter parked in the street in
front of the house. A few guards
loitered in the vicinity, but there
were no crowds. They entered
the plush copter, which rose
smoothly under its whirling
blades and carried them over the
city, landing finally on the lawn
of the Executive Mansion.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Herz met them,
dressed in a blue business suit,
and after they shook hands he
administered the oath.</p>

<p>"Do you, George Wong," he
asked, "swear to make every decision
you are asked to make as
President of the Solar Union for
the benefit of the people of the
Union and in accord with what
you believe to be fair and just,
fully cognizant of the fact that
the welfare of seventy-five billion
citizens of the Union is dependent
on you?"</p>

<p>"I do," George Wong said,
through a painfully dry throat
that would barely permit the
words to come out.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>hey all shook hands again.
Then Al Grimm led the President
across the grassy lawn, into
the mansion, and up to the office
that had served over a thousand
Presidents. Wong entered it nervously.
It was a large plain room,
severely decorated. Tentatively,
he slid into the chair behind the
huge steel desk, and began opening
the drawers. He found them
fully stocked with tapes, a recorder,
all the other necessities.
The desk and everything else in
the room was brand new. There
was no trace anywhere of his
predecessors, and he was relieved
to find it so. The Psychology Department
at work, he thought.</p>

<p>"While we are moving your
effects into the living quarters,
Mr. President," Al said from the
doorway, "I wonder if we could
start discussing the problem of
the Gnii ... their Ambassadors
have presented an ultimatum,
and they demand an answer today."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_s.jpg" alt="S" width="26" height="40" /></div>
<p>o soon, President Wong
thought. Couldn't he have
just a few hours to get used to
his office, to wander through the
building, to explore the green
garden that he could see from his
barred window stretching out behind
the mansion?</p>

<p>For a second, he almost rebelled;
but even as he thought of answering
no, he realized that he
never would. The Psych Agents
had measured his Responsibility
Quotient at 9.6, and they didn't
make mistakes.</p>

<p>"Of course," he answered with
forced enthusiasm. "Who do you
suggest I discuss the matter
with? For that matter, who are
the Gnii?"</p>

<p>"I have the Manager of Defense,
the Manager of Trade, and
the Manager of Foreign Affairs
waiting in the anteroom. With
your permission, I'll call them in
and they'll explain the problem.
But first, if you would sign this
order ... it has already been approved
by President Reynolds
and by all of the Managers concerned."</p>

<p>President Wong took the paper.
It was an order sending a space
platoon, 5,000 warships and 500,000
men, to the system of Altair
A, to place themselves under the
command of the Grasvian fleet
for an attack against the system
of Altair D.</p>

<p>The President frowned. "What's
the story behind this?"</p>

<p>"As you know," Al explained
patiently, "there is an unwritten
agreement throughout the Galaxy
that if any system conquers too
many other systems, an intersystem
police force is formed to
cut the conqueror down. Since
for all practical purposes, there is
an infinity of systems in the Galaxy,
and as each conqueror borders
on more and more of them
as he grows larger in three-dimensional
expansion, unlike the
one-dimensional conquests that
used to occur on the surface of
planets, conquest of the Galaxy
is an obvious impossibility. However,
the inhabitants of Altair D
seem to have embarked on a policy
of reckless expansion that
could reach us in time."</p>

<p>"I see," President Wong said.
"How far away are they?"</p>

<p>"It will take the platoon sixteen
years to get to the rendezvous.
They will remain for ten
years, then return. Because of
the distance, we are not expected
to send more than this token
force."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_p.jpg" alt="P" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>resident Wong looked at
the order. It had already been
signed by President Reynolds, by
the Managers of Defense and of
Foreign Affairs. After all, even
though forty-two years was a
long period of time to chop out
of a man's life, only 500,000 men
were involved, and it was the
duty of every citizen to give his
life for his planet if required.</p>

<p>With an impatient motion, he
rolled his thumbprint in the soft
plastic signature space, and held
it for a second as it hardened.
Then he threw the order into a
basket labeled <span class="smcap">outgoing correspondence</span>.</p>

<p>His first official duty completed,
he should have felt exhilarated;
but instead, nagging
thoughts of guilt tugged at his
brain.</p>

<p>Who were the inhabitants of
Altair D, anyway? How did he
know that the police action was
just? Shouldn't he get out the
whole file and go over it?</p>

<p>But that would take days ...
and there was the matter of the
Gnii, whoever they were.</p>

<p>The three managers entered.
President Wong stood up and
shook hands with them. They
didn't waste time on other preliminaries,
but rushed straight
into business.</p>

<p>"The Gnii," the Manager of
Trade, a large, red-faced man
said, "demand that we remove
our trading planetoid from their
system. They allege that the
planetoid is a security risk, in
that it could be used for remote-control
bombing of any of their
planets. They threaten that if we
don't remove it voluntarily, they
will attack it, and their Ambassadors
are here in person to take
our reply to their ultimatum."</p>

<p>There was nothing unusual in
that, President Wong knew. Since
both spaceships and any other
known means of communication
traveled at the speed of light, it
was now more common to send
Ambassadors on important missions
than to send messages.</p>

<p>"What do you think we should
do?" President Wong asked the
Manager of Trade.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft1"><img src="images/image_i1.jpg" alt="I" width="35" height="40" /></div>
<p>&nbsp; think we should tell them
to go to hell," the Manager
of Trade replied, his heavy face
turning redder. "After all, we
have a million trading planetoids
out in the Galaxy&mdash;if we retreat
here, we set a dangerous precedent."</p>

<p>"I see," Wong said, frowning.
"I don't recall any alien trading
planetoids in <i>our</i> system."</p>

<p>"Of course not, Mr. President,"
said the Manager Of Foreign Affairs,
a tall, lean, distinguished-looking
gentleman with blue eyes
and iron-gray hair. "We don't
permit them, for much the same
reason that the Gnii want them
removed from their system. Trading
planetoids are usually only
tolerated in backward systems.
Apparently the Gnii no longer
desire to be considered backward.
I, for one, think that we would be
making a mistake not to accede
to their request."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's very fine, decent,
sporting and all that," the Manager
of Trade said irritatedly.
"But I have to worry about feeding
this overpopulated system of
ours, which would starve if it
weren't for intersystem trade&mdash;a
significant part of which is carried
on through the planetoids."</p>

<p>"Can we protect the threatened
planetoid?" President Wong asked
the Manager of Defense, a
short, slim black man with flaming
red hair.</p>

<p>The Manager of Defense considered
his reply carefully. "Not
if they are willing to pay a terrific
price to destroy it," he said
finally. "After all, it's thirty-three
years away. While we can
send out a fleet immediately that
would get there at the same time
as the Ambassadors, and before
they could mount an attack, we
hardly could send reinforcements
and replacements once the battle
is joined. But from the best information
available, I think that
a small force of twenty or twenty-five
thousand troops should be
able to frighten the Gnii out of
doing anything foolish. They
aren't very far advanced."</p>

<p>"Thirty-three years," President
Wong said frowning. "That
means a mixed crew with facilities
for children. I am told that
things often go wrong on that
type of mission."</p>

<p>The Manager of Defense nodded.
"They do," he agreed shortly.
"However, I have analyzed
that problem in detail in my report."</p>

<p>President Wong sighed. "If you
gentlemen will leave your reports
with me, I will make my decision
by tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>Each of the Managers gave him
several rolls of tape. Those of the
Manager of Trade felt by far the
heaviest. President Wong slipped
them into the racks in his upper
left-hand desk drawer.</p>

<p>"Ask the Gnii to come in," he
said to Al.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_a.jpg" alt="A" width="37" height="40" /></div>
<p>l pushed a button on the arm
of his chair, and the door
swung open. Four large spidery
creatures entered the room, followed
by a small bald man.
Their round bodies were encased
in plastic globes, in which a
whitish translucent gas swirled.
They walked over to the President's
desk, and the leader extended
a hairy leg.</p>

<p>With an effort, President Wong
forced himself to take the leg
with his hand and pump it up
and down. He noticed that the
creature withdrew the leg as soon
as it was decently possible, and
smiled a bit as he concluded that
their aversion was mutual.</p>

<p>The Gnii stepped back and began
waving his two front legs.</p>

<p>"He is asking for your reply to
his ultimatum," the small bald
man interpreted.</p>

<p>"Tell him I'll give him a definite
decision tomorrow," President
Wong said. "Apologize for my not
being able to reply today, and
point out that since it will take
him thirty-three years to get
home, one day will not make
much difference."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/image_001.jpg" width="800" height="404" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The bald interpreter waved his
hands. The four Gnii went into a
small huddle, waving their spidery
legs at each other. Then the
leader turned to the interpreter
again and "spoke."</p>

<p>"They say that they agree,"
the interpreter said. "But they
want to emphasize that it is not
because they fear the power of
the Solar System."</p>

<p>The Gnii leader hesitated a
moment, then extended his leg
again. President Wong pumped
it once. The Gnii dropped his
hand and turned and left the
room, with the three others and
the interpreter filing after him.</p>

<p>"If you don't need me any
more," the Manager of Trade
said, glancing at his watch, "I'll
go back to the Trade Bureau. I
have a meeting with a number
of the department heads."</p>

<p>President Wong nodded tiredly.
"I have the tapes. I'll study all
your positions tonight."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>he Manager of Trade and
the Manager of Foreign Affairs
rose and left the room. The
Manager of Defense stayed in
his seat.</p>

<p>"If you feel up to it," Al said,
"the Manager of Defense would
appreciate it if you would present
a Presidential citation to the remains
of the Third Company.
They were involved in a police
action in the system of Veganea,
and their morale is shattered. As
you know, the award is traditional,
as is the speech. Here's the
text&mdash;all you need do is read it."</p>

<p>"All right," President Wong
said, taking the paper from Al's
hand and scanning it. There was
only one paragraph.</p>

<p>The door opened and four old
men entered, followed by an honor
guard of eight husky privates.
They approached the desk and
stood at attention. President
Wong looked up from the speech
and felt a wave of sudden nausea.
For a second, he was afraid
that he actually was going to be
sick. None of their old lined faces
was complete. The worst wounded
had less than half a face, and
that discolored by purple blotches
of radiation scar-tissue. He was
blind, and the others maneuvered
him into position before the desk.</p>

<p>"For the heroic parts which
you played in the Police Action
against Veganea&mdash;" Wong stumbled
over the name, then continued
hastily&mdash;"I, the President of
the Solar Union, hereby...."</p>

<p>"Rot," said the blind one,
through toothless gums in a voice
that was only a hoarse whisper.
"Tell me, do you know where
Veganea is? Does anyone on
Earth know where Veganea is, or
care? How many men, Mr. President,
how many men, young and
healthy, left for that police action?
Do you know?" His hoarse
voice rose. "Four came back ... but
can any of you gentlemen
tell me <i>how many left</i>?"</p>

<p>"That's enough," the Manager
of Defense said. At his signal,
two of the honor guards gently
took hold of the veteran's arms
and walked him out of the room
along with the others.</p>

<p>"I order that he not be punished,"
Wong said sharply.</p>

<p>"He won't be," the Manager of
Defense said. "Do you take me
for a barbarian? I had hoped,
though, that your interest might
change their attitude. As you can
imagine, it's raising hell with the
morale of the recruits."</p>

<p>"By the way," the President
asked, "where is Veganea, and
how many men <i>did</i> we send
there?"</p>

<p>"It's about twenty-four years
away, near Vega. The action
started before my time and I
don't know how many men were
involved&mdash;probably not more than
a few million. The Police Action
ended successfully, but our ships
were in the first wave and were
wiped out."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>he President sat down wearily.
His hand strayed over to
the order he had signed that
morning for a police action, then
drifted aimlessly away.</p>

<p>"What's next?" he asked Al.
He slipped a few energy pills into
his mouth as Al consulted his
book.</p>

<p>"There's the matter of the conversion
bomb," Al said. "The
Manager of Scientific Research
and the Manager of Defense
would like you to make a decision
about it."</p>

<p>"The conversion bomb?" President
Wong said, puzzled. "I've
never heard of it."</p>

<p>"It is highest level top secret,"
the Manager of Defense explained.
"Instead of breaking down
atoms and releasing some energy
as in the standard fission weapons,
it converts matter entirely
into energy. Given the matter-energy
equation, the energy released
by a small amount of
matter is fantastic."</p>

<p>Al had risen and gone to the
door. He returned with an old,
gray-haired, stoop-shouldered
man. The President recognized
the famous Manager of Research.</p>

<p>The Manager launched immediately
into his argument without
preliminaries. "Mr. President,
while my department has finally
found a way to convert matter
directly into energy, I believe
that any use of this process would
be disastrous. First, there is absolutely
no safeguard that could
prevent a matter-conversion powered
machine, used for peaceful
purposes, from being changed
into a lethal weapon by the simplest
of alterations. And as a
weapon, the conversion bomb, unlike
atomic bombs, could not
only destroy planets but stars
with their entire systems. We all
know that the law of the Galaxy
is to prevent its domination by
any one system&mdash;and given the
distances and populations involved,
that domination is obviously
impossible. But if we
began to construct conversion
bombs, and if word of it got out,
the whole Galaxy would rise
against us, all the way to the
Edge."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. President," the Manager
of Defense said calmly. "We
are not a unique people. If we
do not produce the conversion
bomb, you may rest assured that
someone else will. Maybe even
our friends, the Gnii. No system
has ever saved itself by refusing
to manufacture the best weapons
available to it. As for the Galaxy
rising against us&mdash;if we have the
conversion bomb, let them! We
will be able to defend ourselves
against any or all of them and
blast their suns into novae."</p>

<p>"Until <i>they</i> have the bomb,"
the Manager of Scientific Research
interrupted. "As you say,
we are not a unique people."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," the President
said, standing up suddenly. "I feel
tired and dizzy. The idea of a
bomb that can wipe out systems
is new to me. If you will leave
your tapes, I will study your
arguments tonight, and we can
resume this discussion tomorrow."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>he two Managers rose immediately,
shook hands with
the President, and left. They did
not speak to each other as they
went through the door.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," Al said, "it's
seven o'clock. Will you join me
for dinner, sir?"</p>

<p>President Wong slumped back
into his seat and stared dully at
Al, only half noticing his friendly
grin. "What would you do about
the Gnii, Al, if you were in my
place?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir," Al said, "but
I really don't know. Better come
along for some dinner. You've
had a hard day, and you have
a harder one ahead of you tomorrow.
We saved a number of
difficult problems that we didn't
want to throw at you on your
first day in office."</p>

<p>A ghost of a smile crept over
the President's face, then disappeared
quickly. "It's all right, Al.
Go ahead and eat. I think I'll
just stay here and go over these
tapes."</p>

<p>As Al left, President Wong saw
the order for the police action on
his desk. He picked it up to call
Al to take it with him, but his
eyes caught the words <i>500,000
men</i> ... <i>sixteen years</i>, and a picture
of the terribly wounded veterans
flashed before his eyes.
Really, he would have to go
through the files and find out if
the expedition was necessary....</p>

<p>He opened the left-hand desk
drawer and stared at the Gnii
tapes, but he didn't take any of
them out. It seemed like too much
of an effort.</p>

<p>And then, the conversion bomb
was so much more important.</p>

<p>He closed the first drawer and
opened the one with the conversion
bomb tapes.</p>

<p>But the Gnii had to be answered
tomorrow&mdash;the bomb
could wait. He slammed the
drawer shut.</p>

<p>"Gnii," he muttered to himself,
and opened the other drawer.</p>

<p>Then he noticed that he had
put the police action order back
into his <span class="smcap">outgoing</span> basket. He
slammed the drawer with the Gnii
tapes shut again and opened the
drawer below it and pushed the
order inside, so that it wouldn't
be picked up by mistake before
he could check on it.</p>

<p>"Five hundred thousand men
in here," he said as he closed the
drawer. "Going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Where were they supposed to
go? He couldn't remember. He
opened the drawer again and
looked at the order. To Altair D.
The name had no meaning for
him.</p>

<p>Now, let's see ... oh, yes, the
conversion bomb tape.</p>

<p>He opened the drawer to take
out the tapes, and remembered
that the Gnii ultimatum had to
be answered by tomorrow.</p>

<p>"Gnii, Gnu, Gnuts," he said,
opening a drawer. It was the
wrong one, and the tapes weren't
there. Which tapes?</p>

<p>The door opened, and President
Wong looked up to see Al's
smiling face peering in.</p>

<p>"I was passing by, sir," Al said,
"and I wondered if I couldn't
talk you into supper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Get out!</i>" the President shouted.</p>

<p>The door closed softly.</p>

<p>Now where was he?... Oh, yes,
the conversion bomb. Conversion,
conversion, conversation, bomb,
bomb, boom, <i>BOOM</i>. But that
wasn't it either&mdash;it was the Gnii,
they had to be answered by tomorrow....
Gnii, Gnii, Gnu,
Gnuts, now in what drawer had
he put the gnats? And why order
a police action against Gnats?
Just convert every one of them
into spiders....</p>

<p>l walked slowly down the
hall, his grin gone, his face
looking washed out. He turned
into his own little office and
snapped on the communications
video.</p>

<p>"First Vice-President Michael
Thompson," he said to the operator.</p>

<p>In a moment Thompson appeared
on the screen.</p>

<p>"Mr. First Vice-President," Al
said in a tired voice, "may I
suggest that you remain in the
Capital for the next few weeks?"</p>

<p>Even though he knew that it
was not polite, Al snapped off
the set without waiting for a reply&mdash;but
not before he caught the
white and frightened look on
Thompson's face.</p>
